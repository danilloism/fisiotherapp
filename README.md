# Welcome :)

## Challenge
The task was to build a react native app with the design avaible inside the '/design' folder, but I changed a little bit and did it with Flutter.
## Techs: 
Dart<br>
Flutter

## About the app: 
It's a simple app with two screens that helps pacients with their fisiotherapy exercises (only UI for now)

## Screenshots:

</p>

## Specifications:
The application has 2 screens.<br>
The first is the welcome page, where the user can start the treatment.<br>
The second is the exercise page, in which the necessary steps are given to the user

# How to run the app:
1. Clone this repository
2. Run ```flutter run``` inside the project directory to build and run the app (you must have an iPhone or Android emulator running)
